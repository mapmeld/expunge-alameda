            <h3>When I was 16 I got arrested for stealing a car</h3>
            <p>I did my time in juvie and my community service and I was done.
              Last year I tried to get a job at SnapChat and they were about to hire me,
              but wanted me to have a clean arrest record.
              I was scared af bc I thought about my record.
            <br/><br/>
              I came to expunge.io and did the steps and got my record sealed in 4 months.</p>

            <h3>The nursing school I applied to rejected my application.</h3>
            <p>I was devastated. I had no idea what was going on. My grades were good, my test scores were good. They told me I would have been accepted, but I had an arrest record for shoplifting. I thought that since it happened when I was 13, it would automatically be erased but apparently not. I Googled for how to fix it and expunge.io came up in the results. I'm working on getting my arrest record sealed right now (2 more weeks!) and will be able to re-apply for nursing school next semester without any worries</p>

            <h3>I needed to get rental assistance, but since I got busted for possession of marijuana, I didn't</h3>
            <p>My mom told me about expunge.io and i found a lawyer who helped me get my arrest record expunged. i didn't even know what expunged meant before this. 6 months later my record is sealed and i'm living in my new place.</p>
